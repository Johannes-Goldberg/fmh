You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). For now, you have to install the development versions of bookdown from Github: devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need to install XeLaTeX. "],

If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

Cortical landmarks as seen on MRI can be applied for the localization of eloquent brain regions. This chapter illustrates methods for the identification of key anatomical landmarks based on their specific form, course and their relationship to adjacent structures. 7.1 Primary Motor and Sensory Cortex / Central Sulcus The central sulcus is a prominent landmark, separating the primary motor cortex in the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe from the primary sensory cortex in the postcental gyrus of the parietal lobe. It is particularly well identifiable on transverse sections. The following signs help identify the central sulcus in transverse and sagittal sections (Fig. 7.1, 7.2, 7.3). 7.1.1 L Sign The superior frontal sulcus (SFS) joins in its antero-posterior course the precentral sulcus (PCS) in an almost perpendicular fashion resembling an upper case ‘L’ (L Sign / SFS-PCS Sign). The central sulcus is the next posterior, parallel sulcus (Fig. 7.1). 7.1.2 Omega Sign The motor hand area is most often contained in a knob-like, posterior protuberance of the precentral gyrus, shaping the central sulcus into an inverted omega ‘℧’. It is also known as the ‘middle-knee’ of the precentral gyrus (Fig. 7.1). 7.1.3 Thin-Postcentral-Gyrus Sign The antero-posterior diameter of the postcentral gyrus is smaller than that of the precentral gyrus (Fig. 7.1). 7.1.4 Pars-Bracket Sign On sagittal sections the cingulate sulcus ascends in its antero-posterior course to the surface of the parietal lobe and separates the paracentral lobule from the precuneus as the marginal sulcus. On reaching the cortical surface it forms a characteristic anteriorly opened bracket that can be appreciated on transverse sections. The central sulcus is situated immediately anterior and parallel to the bracket (Fig. 7.1, 7.3). Figure 7.1: Transverse section of T1W-MRI; blue: superior frontal sulcus &amp; precentral sulcus (L Sign), red: central sulcus (Omega Sign), yellow: marginal part of the cingulate sulcus or marginal sulcus (Pars-Bracket Sign), green: thickness of precentral &amp; postcentral gyrus (Thin-Postcentral-Gyrus Sign) 7.1.5 T Sign The well identifiable inferior frontal sulcus (IFS) and the precentral sulcus (PCS) intersect almost perpendicular forming an upper case T tilted 90° clockwise (IFS-PCS-sign). The central sulcus is located immediately parallel and posterior to the roof of the T (Fig. 7.2). 7.2 Speech Associated Areas / Inferior Frontal Gyrus 7.2.1 M Sign The inferior frontal gyrus forms a typical upper case M shape on sagittal sections. It can be subdivided into three macroanatomical parts from anterior to posterior represented by the legs of the upper case M (orbital, triangular and opercular). The triangular and opercular parts of the dominant hemisphere are active in semantic and word generation tasks and have become known as Broca’s area (Fig. 7.2). 7.2.2 T Sign The inferior frontal gyrus is superiorly bound by the inferior frontal sulcus and posteriorly by the inferior precentral sulcus. Both are part of the sagittal T Sign (See Central Sulcus | T Sign) (Fig. 7.2). 7.3 Supramarginal Gyrus The silvian fissure ascends with its posterior ramus into the inferior parietal lobule where it is imbedded into the semicircular supramarginal gyrus with horseshoe appearance. It is involved in phonological word choices and visual word recognition (Fig. 7.2). 7.4 Angular Gyrus Just inferior to the sylvial fissure lies the superior temporal gyrus and sulcus. The superior temporal sulcus ascends posteriorly, parallel to the silvian fissure. Its dorsal upswing is called the angular sulcus which is imbedded by the curved angular gyrus, that is situated directly posterior to the supramarginal gyrus. The angular gyrus plays a role in language processing, arithmetics and spatial cognition. Demage to the angular gyrus of the dominant hemisphere can manifest as Gerstmann’s syndrome (Fig. 7.2). Figure 7.2: Sagittal section of T1W-MRI: orange: inferior frontal gyrus (M Sign), blue: inferior frontal sulcus &amp; precentral sulcus (T Sign), red: central sulcus, yellow: supramarginal gyrus, green: angular gyrus 7.5 Primary Visual Cortex / Calcarine Sulcus 7.5.1 Lazy-Y Sign The occipital and parietal lobes are separated by the perieto-occipital sulcus. It can be appreciated in just off midline sagittal sections and runs roughly parallel to the marginal sulcus in an oblique fashion from antero-inferior to supero-posterior. The calcarine sulcus runs from almost the occipital pole anteriorly where it ends just below the splenium of the corpus callosum. In its anterior part it is joined in an acute angle by the parieto-occipital sulcus forming a 90° clockwise tilted lazy-Y. The banks of the calcarine sulcus contain the primary visual cortex (Fig. 7.3). Figure 7.3: Sagittal section of T1W-MRI just off midline: yellow: cingulate gyrus with ascending marginal part, red: central sulcus, purple: parieto-occipital sulcus, blue: calcarine sulcus 7.6 Primary Auditory Cortex / Transverse Temporal Gyrus of Heschl Hidden within the posterior part of the sylvian fissure the transverse temporal gyrus of Heschl is the first cortical structure to process incoming auditory information. It can be appreciated in transverse crossections as the first mediolaterally running gyrus of the temporal lobe, posterior to the insular cortex (Fig. 7.4).
